# Basic Field Wave Simulator

A basic field wave generator i wrote to learn sdl and oop on cpp. Handle with care. 

Scene can be specified with .cpp files. 

## Compiling
Download `g++` and `make` to your pc. Then clone this directory to a folder. Finally simply call `make` or `make sdl` commands in your terminal to compile main.cpp or sdl.cpp respectively.
